# Autonomous Web Automation Platform Implementation Plan

This plan outlines actionable steps for translating the provided technical specification into an engineering roadmap. It focuses on decomposing major components, sequencing milestones, and highlighting key considerations—particularly around the Gemini streaming fix that underpins the AI Planning & Decision System.

## 1. Foundational Infrastructure

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Initialize monorepo structure (e.g., `/services`, `/packages`, `/apps`).
   - Configure shared tooling: TypeScript project references, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and lint-staged.
   - Establish CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) with lint, type-check, unit, and integration test jobs.

2. **Core Platform Services**
   - Scaffold microservices listed in the spec (Auth, Task Orchestrator, Automation Engine, Knowledge Base, etc.).
   - Provide base Express.js HTTP server, health checks, structured logging (pino/winston), and OpenTelemetry instrumentation in each service.

3. **API Gateway & Service Mesh**
   - Implement API Gateway (e.g., Kong, Express BFF) with rate limiting and authentication middleware.
   - Configure service discovery (Consul or built-in Kubernetes DNS) and mutual TLS for inter-service calls.

## 2. AI Planning & Decision System

1. **Gemini Integration Layer**
   - Create a dedicated `geminiService.ts` responsible for:
     - Managing API keys via environment variables and secrets management (e.g., Vault).
     - Handling request retries with exponential backoff.
     - Supporting streaming responses and metadata extraction.

2. **Streaming Fix Implementation**
   - Use server-sent events or incremental fetch parsing to process Gemini responses.
   - Buffer partial chunks, detect message boundaries, and emit structured payloads `{ text, citations }`.
   - Implement graceful degradation: if streaming fails, fall back to non-streaming request and log telemetry.
   - Add unit tests covering chunk concatenation, citation parsing, and timeout handling.

3. **Planner Orchestration**
   - Define interfaces for planner inputs (environment state, objectives) and outputs (action graph, rationale, resource needs).
   - Integrate with Task Orchestrator to enqueue executable subtasks.
   - Store reasoning artifacts and citations in Knowledge Base for auditability.

## 3. Automation Engine & Execution Layer

1. **Browser Automation (Playwright)**
   - Build abstraction for launching Playwright workers with configurable contexts (headless/headful, device profiles).
   - Implement resilient action runners with automatic retries, DOM stability checks, and screenshot capture on failure.

2. **Workflow Templates**
   - Define reusable YAML/JSON templates describing multi-step automations (login, navigation, data extraction).
   - Provide validation schemas using Zod or Joi to ensure safe execution.

3. **Observation & Feedback Loop**
   - Capture execution logs, telemetry, and DOM snapshots.
   - Send summaries back to the AI Planning system for iterative refinement.

## 4. Security & Compliance Framework

1. **Identity & Access Management**
   - Implement OAuth2/OpenID Connect for user authentication; use RBAC for role scoping.
   - Harden API Gateway with JWT validation and rate limiting.

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt data at rest (KMS-managed keys) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).
   - Apply field-level encryption for sensitive automation credentials.

3. **Audit & Monitoring**
   - Centralize logs in ELK stack; enforce immutable audit trail for all agent actions.
   - Define alerting thresholds for anomalous activity (e.g., unexpected domain access).

## 5. Delivery Milestones

1. **Milestone A – Core Skeleton (Weeks 1-3)**
   - Repo scaffolding, CI/CD, shared tooling.
   - Initial service stubs with health checks and API contracts.

2. **Milestone B – AI Planning MVP (Weeks 4-6)**
   - Gemini streaming integration completed and tested.
   - Planner producing executable task graphs persisted to Knowledge Base.

3. **Milestone C – Automation Engine Alpha (Weeks 7-9)**
   - Playwright-based execution with sandboxed runtime.
   - Feedback loop from executor to planner operational.

4. **Milestone D – Security & Observability Hardening (Weeks 10-12)**
   - IAM integration, encryption, audit logging.
   - Comprehensive monitoring dashboards and alerting.

## 6. Risk Mitigation Highlights

- **Streaming Instability:** Implement circuit breakers and fallback polling for Gemini API outages.
- **Scaling Web Automation:** Use Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler with queue depth metrics to scale executor workers.
- **Data Leakage:** Enforce domain allowlists and sensitive data redaction in logs.

## 7. Next Steps for the Team

1. Approve this implementation roadmap and adjust timelines based on team capacity.
2. Prioritize the Gemini streaming fix; create detailed tickets for parsing, error handling, and telemetry.
3. Begin scaffolding repositories and shared packages to accelerate parallel development across services.

This plan can be expanded into Jira epics or GitHub Projects issues to drive execution. Let me know if you would like detailed user stories or example code stubs for any specific component.
