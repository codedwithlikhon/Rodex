# Rodex Autonomous Web Automation Platform

This repository contains the scaffolding and initial planning artifacts for the Rodex autonomous web automation platform. The immediate focus is resolving the Gemini streaming reliability issues while laying down infrastructure for the Playwright-based automation engine.

## Repository Layout
- `docs/` ‚Äì Planning artifacts and architecture notes.
- `services/` ‚Äì Python packages for planner and automation services.
- `configs/` ‚Äì Environment and tooling configuration templates.
- `infra/` ‚Äì Docker and Terraform infrastructure scaffolding.
- `tests/` ‚Äì Placeholder for automated test suites.

## Getting Started
1. Create a virtual environment (recommended via `uv` or `poetry`).
2. Install base dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[planner,automation]
   ```
3. Copy `configs/base.env` to `.env` and populate secrets.
4. Review `configs/project_settings.json` for deployment metadata and Gemini
   defaults. The same manifest ships inside the package so runtime environments
   always have sane defaults; override via environment variables or secret
   manager entries when deploying to non-local environments.
5. Install Playwright browsers:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install-deps
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```

## Next Steps
Refer to `docs/initial_development_plan.md` for a detailed 48-hour work breakdown and prioritized tasks.
